# AM210 Final Project

All code used to perform the analysis for option 2 of the AM210 Fall 2025 project are contained in the final_project_code.ipynb file. The dataset used for this project can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/solar-pv-generation-time-series?resource=download&select=readme_solar.txt (was too large to upload to Github!).
